# Default prompts and chat suggestions
#
# Server reads this on boot via `services/chat/promptsLoader.ts`.
# Sections start with `## ` and the body runs until the next `## ` heading.
# Mustache-style {{placeholders}} get substituted at call time.
# `## suggestions/...` sections are sent to the UI via /api/system → chat.suggestions.
#
# Override by creating ~/.config/comfyui-studio/chat/default_prompts.md;
# the user file wins over this bundled default whenever it exists.

## tool-description.web-search
Search the public web via a SearXNG metasearch engine. Returns a numbered list of titles, URLs, and snippets — use the URLs as citations when answering the user.

## tool-description.rag-search
Search the user's RAGFlow knowledge bases for relevant chunks. Each result includes the source document name plus the matching text — quote the chunks back when answering and cite the source document name.

## tool-description.rag-upload
Upload a publicly reachable file URL into a RAGFlow knowledge base. The file is downloaded server-side and forwarded to RAGFlow which queues it for chunking + embedding asynchronously.

## tool-description.generate-image
Generate an image from a text prompt. Call this whenever the user asks for a picture, image, photo, illustration, render, painting, drawing, or any visual. Pass the user's request as `prompt`; optionally set width / height / steps / seed / cfg / sampler / negative_prompt when the user specifies (e.g. "4K" → width=3840, height=2160). The image appears in chat when ready.
